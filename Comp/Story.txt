Square Sums (Easy/Hard)

This problem statement is identical to Square Sums (Hard/Easy). The only difference is the constraint on k and N_i.

STATEMENT
Russell loves squares, and he loves adding numbers together. Russell likes to put numbers in order such that two numbers next to each other can add up to a square number. He wonders if it is possible to determine whether or not a group of numbers can be ordered in this way, so he turns to you for help.

A square-sum sequence (the kind Russell likes) is a sequence of distinct natural numbers such that every pair of adjacent numbers in the sequence sum to a square number, a number that results from multiplying an integer by itself. Given a set of k distinct natural numbers N_1, N_2, ..., N_k, you need to determine if these numbers can be arranged to form a square-sum sequence of length k.

For example, the set of six numbers 1, 3, 6, 8, 10, and 15 can be rearranged into the square-sum sequence 3, 6, 10, 15, 1, 8, where each pair of adjacent numbers sum to a square number (3+6 = 9, 6+10 = 16, 10+15 = 25, 15+1 = 16, 1+8 = 9).

INPUT
The first line of input contains a single integer k: how many natural number are the given set. (Is this needed? Can this be derived from the set of integers in the next line?)
The second line of input contains k distinct integers in ascending order, N_1, N_2, ..., N_k, separated by spaces.

We have the following constraints:
(Easy)
2≤k≤8
1≤N_1 < N_2 < ... < N_k ≤100

(Hard)
2≤k≤30
1≤N_i≤10000

Output
The output consists of a single line, containing the text YES or NO.

Output YES if the set of integers N_1, N_2, ..., N_k can be rearranged into a square-sum sequence; otherwise output NO.
